gameplay.js

Draws game area with fabric.js and handles gameplay logic.
Shows calibration screen and prompts in the instruction div.
Then triggers game mode with K number of challenges and background music.

Does fabric.js have a setup()? that is probably the right place to put
initializing game control flow.
