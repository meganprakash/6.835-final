# Take Up Space!

## 6.835 Final Project, Spring 2021

Please go to https://meganprakash.github.io/6.835-final/ to play the game. It requires webcam and microphone access, as well as an approximately 8' x 8' space in front of your computer to move around in. It has been tested in Google Chrome on a Mac, which causes the game to use Google Chrome's native speech recognition. It has not been tested in other environments.
